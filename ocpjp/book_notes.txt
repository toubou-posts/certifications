CHAPTER 1 Java class design


A derived class can also overload the methods inherited from its base class.

The overloaded methods are bound at compile time and not runtime (that is, we only mind for the reference variable (emp, in our case): Employee emp = new CEO();  )
To resolve the call to the overloaded methods, the compiler considers the type of variable thatâ€™s used to refer to an object.

An int literal value can be passed to a variable of type double.
