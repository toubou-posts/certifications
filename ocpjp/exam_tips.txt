CHAPTER 1 Java class design

Calls to the overloaded methods are resolved during compilation.

For primitive method arguments, if a call to an overloaded method is dubious, the code won’t compile.

When the Java compiler differentiates methods, it doesn’t consider their return types. So you can’t define overloaded methods with the same parameter list and different return types.

overloaded constructors are invoked by using the keyword this

when you invoke an overloaded constructor using the keyword this, it must be the first statement in your constructor
