CHAPTER 1 Java class design

Calls to the overloaded methods are resolved during compilation.

For primitive method arguments, if a call to an overloaded method is dubious, the code won’t compile.

When the Java compiler differentiates methods, it doesn’t consider their return types. So you can’t define overloaded methods with the same parameter list and different return types.
