CHAPTER 1 Java class design

Calls to the overloaded methods are resolved during compilation.

For primitive method arguments, if a call to an overloaded method is dubious, the code won’t compile.

When the Java compiler differentiates methods, it doesn’t consider their return types. So you can’t define overloaded methods with the same parameter list and different return types.

If a parent or child class defines static initializer block(s), they execute before all parent and child class constructors and instance initializers—first for the parent and then for the child class.
